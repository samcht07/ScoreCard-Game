Students choose an enrichment cohort and work side-by-side with their peers to dive deeply into their selected content area. Through guest speakers, field trips, and authentic learning tasks, students become experts in their selected field and work towards a culminating capstone project in senior year, during which they solve a self-identified problem or question and present their findings to the community. As a result, students grow as independent thinkers and apply what they learn to devise solutions that have a positive impact on their world. In addition, we offer opportunities for students to pursue their interests in sports, music, drama, clubs, foreign language, and writing—both during and after school. Parents have a voice in school-based decisions via the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, fundraising, and our varied parent engagement events.","postcode":"11218","printedschoolname":"M.S. 890","schoolday":"N/A","schooldbn":"22K890","selectioncriteria1_prog1":"Students who apply to this program will be randomly selected","sharedbuilding":"No","subway":"F, G, to Fort Hamilton Parkway; Q to Beverley Road","summersession":"Yes–Academic support for certain students","swdapps_prog1":"16","swdappsperseat_prog1":"1","swdfilled_prog1":"N","swdseats_prog1":"15","telephone":"N/A","uniform":"Yes","weekendprogram":"Yes–Saturday program for academic support and enrichment."}
